# candy-game-project
by: Sonia Mezali

## what is it?
This is my first project for IronHack bootcamp.
It's made with HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.

It's the "CANDYGAME".

## What is the goal?

here are the rules of the game:

The objective of the game is to catch the red candies to
score 5 points. However, be careful because the purple candies are
toxic and move randomly, and if you touch them, you will lose all
your points. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your basket
and catch the candies. 



## why?

This type of game is both fun and frustrating at the same time. It can be entertaining because it challenges your reflexes and hand-eye coordination. However, it can also be frustrating because just when you think you're about to win and reach the required score, the situation can change suddenly, and you might lose all your points. Therefore, you need to be vigilant and keep your focus throughout the game. The CandyGame continues until you reach the objective of catching five red candies without touching any purple candies. So, it's important to keep playing until you achieve your goal and have that satisfying feeling of accomplishment.

The CandyGame project allowed me to apply what I've learned during the two first weeks of IronHack bootcamp.


## Features:

- candies fall randomly from the top of the screen.
- the behavior of the different elements in the game.
